Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,6.0,175159.0,55.0,,95.9,,,,2019-07-16T17:17:11.635Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,16.0,56289.0,57.0,,98.6,,,,2019-07-16T17:11:21.432Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

L. rhamnosus have been used as effective probiotic candidates to control food-borne pathogen in various domestic animals and poultry (Higgins et al. 2008). We tested the efficacy of this strain to reduce Salmonella colonization and survival in vitro (Muyyarikkandy and Amalradjou 2007). We observed that L. rhamnosus NRRL B 442 significantly inhibited the growth of S. Enteritidis, S. Heidelberg, and S.

Catalase genes were found in the identified Lactobacillus taxa, which is a unique feature within this mostly facultative anaerobic genus.

We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,7.0,188995.0,72.0,,96.0,,,,2019-07-16T16:17:43.942Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations. These freely available genomic resources should greatly facilitate investigations into the human gut microbiome.",,1.0,3268766.0,72.0,,95.9,,,,2019-10-03T14:45:37.595Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.","sample_type:single bacterial cell;biomaterial_provider:Laboratory for Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Cultures Technology, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, University of Zagreb",3.0,499948.0,65.0,,95.3,,,,2020-02-02T03:17:24.385Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,9.0,129563.0,62.0,,95.9,100.0,0.0,,2017-11-23T08:19:42.036Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,11.0,102066.0,63.0,,95.3,100.0,2.0,,2017-11-23T08:20:22.336Z

Then, we compared the its transcriptome of the strain L. plantarum A6when grown in a food matrix made from pearl millet to its transcriptome when the strain is cultivated into culture medium using next generation sequencing. Genomic comparison with the strains L. plantarum WCFS1, ST-III, JDM1 and ATCC14917 allowed the identification of 362 coding sequences specific to L. plantarum A6. Furthermore, Ggenes coding important functions important for nutritional quality of the food have also been identified:, such as those involved in metabolism of polyphenols , have been identified. Some complete biosynthetic biosynthesis pathways such asof folate among others.and their expression has been characterized. In addition, Cconsidering its interest as efficiency as an amylolytic bacteriastrain, we investigated all genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, giving special attention to starch metabolism. An extracellular alpha amylase, a neopullulanase and the maltodextrin transporters are were identified and were all highly expressed in food matrix.The combination of genomic and transcriptomic not only revealed undocumented nutritional properties of L. plantarum A6, but also documented the behaviour of this bacteria in food.",,1.0,3308392.0,68.0,,95.9,100.0,0.0,,2017-11-24T17:34:29.824Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,7.0,58663.0,64.0,,99.1,,,,2019-07-17T18:31:17.164Z

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Previous study has revealed that the acquisition of ART bacteria and AR genes impacts the shift of microbial composition and resistome in the gut microbiota.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,8.0,74016.0,103.0,,98.5,,,,2019-07-16T16:15:21.689Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Combining metabolomic and proteomic analyses of serially collected plasma samples with metagenomic analyses of fecal samples, we characterized the biological state of Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as they transitioned, following standard treatment, to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. Gnotobiotic mice were subsequently colonized with a defined consortium of bacterial strains representing different stages of microbiota development in healthy children. Administering different combinations of Bangladeshi complementary food ingredients to colonized and germ-free mice revealed diet-dependent changes in the relative abundance and metabolism of weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota, plus diet- and colonization-dependent effects on host metabolism and growth-associated signaling pathways. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes were subsequently examined in gnotobiotic mice colonized with post-SAM MAM microbiota and in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with a defined consortium of targeted age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. Finally, a randomized, double-blind study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacterial taxa and increases plasma levels of biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function.",,4.0,146683.0,53.0,,98.1,,,,2019-10-03T08:25:17.318Z

We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations. These freely available genomic resources should greatly facilitate investigations into the human gut microbiome.",,1.0,801884.0,70.0,,99.6,,,,2019-10-03T12:17:34.229Z

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:BEI Resources/American Type and Culture Collection (ATCC),1.0,1609019.0,57.0,,97.9,,,,2019-12-31T17:07:57.640Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,3.0,312889.0,59.0,,98.6,,,,2019-07-18T16:55:50.864Z

Artificial sweeteners are implicated in having prebiotic effects\; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate alterations in composition and diversity of gut microbiota in piglets consuming feed containing the artificial sweetener SUCRAM (consisting of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and saccharin), with the most notable change being a significant increase in abundance of gut Lactobacillaceae. In vitro analysis of lactobacillus growth characteristics and sugar transporter gene expression shows that neohesperidin dihydrochalcone reduces the lag phase of growth and enhances expression of sugar transporters. This increases the capacity for sugar uptake, explaining the in vivo effect of NHDC in promoting Lactobacillaceae populations. This study describes a novel mode of action of an artificial sweetener and its prebiotic potential in enhancing the growth of health promoting gut microbiota.",isolate:OTU4228,5.0,154336.0,50.0,,98.3,100.0,3.2,,2016-01-17T16:02:14.384Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,3.0,240687.0,53.0,,96.8,,,,2019-07-16T17:16:17.955Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,15.0,65569.0,61.0,,96.7,,,,2019-07-16T16:02:25.577Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,12.0,64589.0,59.0,,95.7,,,,2019-07-16T16:17:18.252Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,16.0,50705.0,58.0,,96.3,,,,2019-07-17T20:28:17.017Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,2.0,522104.0,85.0,,98.1,,,,2019-07-17T11:48:51.088Z

Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,3.0,273258.0,86.0,,98.6,,,,2019-07-15T20:55:40.084Z

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree.

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,4.0,322154.0,58.0,,99.1,100.0,0.0,,2017-11-23T08:59:24.535Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,12.0,67337.0,64.0,,99.2,100.0,0.0,,2017-11-23T08:22:29.620Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,1.0,2009583.0,57.0,,99.0,,,,2021-01-01T20:44:09.218Z

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,3.0,302347.0,52.0,,99.0,,,,2019-07-15T20:59:22.414Z

Deciphering the genetic bases that determine the LAB fermentation type, and hence carbohydrate utilization, is paramount to optimize LAB industrial processes. Deep sequencing of 24 LAB species and comparison with 32 publicly available genome sequences provided a comparative data set including five major LAB genera for further analysis. Phylogenomic reconstruction confirmed Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species as independently emerging from the Lactobacillus genus, within one of the three phylogenetic clades identified. These clades partially grouped LABs according to their fermentation types, suggesting some metabolic capabilities were independently acquired during LAB evolution. In order to apply a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the multigene family level, utilization of 49 carbohydrates was also profiled for these 56 LAB species. GWAS results indicated that obligately heterofermentative species lack 1-phosphofructokinase, required for D-mannose degradation in the homofermentative pathway. Heterofermentative species were found to often contain the araBAD operon, involved in L-arabinose degradation, which is important for heterofermentation. Taken together, our results provide helpful insights into the genetic determinants of LAB carbohydrate metabolism, and opens for further experimental research, aiming at validating the role of these candidate genes for industrial applications.",sample_type:cell culture,6.0,157362.0,63.0,,96.5,,,,2019-07-18T21:04:28.719Z

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations. These freely available genomic resources should greatly facilitate investigations into the human gut microbiome.",,5.0,180550.0,72.0,,98.6,,,,2019-10-03T10:47:36.960Z

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.
